# AzureDataEngineering-NYCProject
Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering pipeline using the NYC Taxi dataset. The solution is built on the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) and leverages multiple Azure services to ingest, transform, store, and analyze large-scale data.

The project simulates a real-world data engineering workflow with ETL pipelines, Delta Lake, and Synapse Analytics integration.
